#+TITLE: emacs-cody: Sourcegraph Cody in Emacs

Do not use this, it is in development.

This project currently lives at https://github.com/keegancsmith/emacs-cody. If
it ever graduates to being useful it will migrate to the sourcegraph org.

* Status

Can start the cody-agent and send it initialize. It fetches your access token
via auth-source and hardcodes the instance and codebase.

To try it out evaluate the buffer. Then try out the cody--request function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-file "emacs-cody.el")

  (cody--request 'recipes/list)
  (cody--request 'recipes/execute
                 :id "code-question"
                 :humanChatInput "Does cody work in emacs?")
#+end_src

Right now it always timesout for me. You can view the output by switching to
the =*cody output*= buffer. Alternatively run =list-processes= and select the
buffer. You can also shut down cody by hitting =d= on the cody process.
