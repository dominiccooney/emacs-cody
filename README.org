#+TITLE: emacs-cody: Sourcegraph Cody in Emacs

Do not use this, it is in development.

This project currently lives at https://github.com/keegancsmith/emacs-cody. If
it ever graduates to being useful it will migrate to the sourcegraph org.

* Status

Starts and initializes the agent, and establishes a jsonrpc connection.
It uses a distributed copy of the Cody agent as compressed javascript, but
you can override this by specifying the location of the agent binary, e.g.:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq cody--agent-binary
         "/path/to/eg/cody/agent/dist/agent-macos-arm64/agent-macos-arm64")
#+end_src

Fetches your access token via auth-source and hardcodes the instance
and codebase. You can currently bypass this by setting your access
token directly:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq cody--access-token "sgp_etc")
#+end_src

To try it out, evaluate the buffer.

* Available commands

  `M-x cody` will start Cody and prompt you with available commands
  `M-x cody-chat` will pop you immediately into the Q&A command

The chat is currently pretty unsatisfying - your queries are done in
the minibuffer, and the output is appended to a read-only chat buffer.
In the future it should probably work more like ChatGPT or a shell.

* Debugging

  `M-x cody-start` to start and initialize the agent without doing a command
  `M-x cody-force-unload` to tear everything down

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-file "emacs-cody.el")
  
  (cody--request 'recipes/list)
  (cody--request 'recipes/execute
                 :id "code-question"
                 :humanChatInput "Does cody work in emacs?")
#+end_src

You can view the output by switching to the =*cody output*= and
=*cody events*= buffer. You can also see debugging messages in the
=*cody log*= buffer.

You can shut down the connection with =*M-x cody-shutdown*=, or shut
it down and remove all traces with =*M-x cody-force-unload*=.

Alternatively run =list-processes= and select the buffer. You can also
shut down cody by hitting =d= on the cody process.


* Attaching with a Debugger

Start by binding =*cody-agent-command*= to a list like this one,
which points to the path of the agent that you have cloned.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq cody-agent-command
        (list "node"
              "/Users/stevey/src/sg/cody/agent/dist/index.js"
              ""))
#+end_src

This will allow you to rebuild and reattach in a tight dev loop.

Restart Cody, e.g. with =*M-x cody-restart*=, and then verify that
Cody is running the version of the agent in =*cody-agent-command*=.

#+begin_src sh
  $ ps aux | grep node
  stevey           31174   0.0  0.3 420886240 171792   ??  Ss    4:08PM 0:00.88 /Users/stevey/.asdf/installs/nodejs/20.4.0/bin/node /Users/stevey/src/sg/cody/agent/dist/index.js 
#+end_src

To have it listen for the debugger to attach, you can either run
the script =*./bin/debug-cody*=, or send the sigusr1 to the pid of
the node process yourself like so:

#+begin_src sh
  $ kill -USR1 31174
#+end_src

Either way, your Agent should now be listening for a debugger.

Now you can attach with =*chrome://inspect*= or with VSCode's debugger.

You should also =*(setq jsonrpc-default-request-timeout 500)*= to ensure
that the jsonrpc calls don't time out while you're paused at breakpoints.

N.B. Cody in Emacs does not yet use threads, so if you hit a breakpoint,
Emacs will lock up until you continue or detach the debugger.
